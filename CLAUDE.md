# Studio

**No bloat. No hallucinated capabilities. Only document what actually works. If you're unsure whether something is real, ask — don't invent.**

## Dependencies

- **Playwright MCP** — Browser automation for navigating webpages
- **Figma MCP** — Design creation via `generate_figma_design`
- **Slack MCP** — User notifications

## What This Does

One flow: capture a webpage and recreate it as a Figma design. See `agents/designer.md` and `skills/webpage-capture.md`.

## File Storage

- `work/` — Projects and deliverables
- `agents/` — Agent definitions
- `skills/` — Reusable procedures
- `skills/scripts/` — Automation scripts

## Git Commits

Title + detailed description with Problem/Solution/Changes/Impact structure.

## Communication

Direct, no fluff. Say when something is broken.
