# User Research Synthesis

Structured method for organizing and interpreting existing user research data into actionable insights.

## Process

1. **Organize by theme** — Group findings into coherent categories
2. **Rank insights** — Prioritize by impact and confidence level
3. **Connect to decisions** — Link each finding to specific design decisions it should inform
4. **Identify gaps** — Note what the research doesn't answer
5. **Recommend follow-ups** — Suggest additional research if critical gaps exist

## Output

Use the [research summary](research-summary.md) skill to structure findings.

## Quality Checks

- Findings organized by theme, not by source
- Impact and confidence rated for each insight
- Clear connection between findings and design decisions
- Knowledge gaps explicitly called out, not papered over
- Follow-up research is specific ("test X with Y users") not vague ("do more research")
