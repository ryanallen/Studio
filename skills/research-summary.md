# Research Summary

Template and process for writing up research findings. Used by both the researcher (to structure output) and the documenter (to create formal write-ups).

## When to Use

After any research activity — competitive analysis, current state audit, pattern research, user research synthesis.

## Template

```markdown
# [Research Topic] — Findings

## Key Insights
1. [Most important finding] — [supporting evidence]
2. [Second finding] — [supporting evidence]
3. [Third finding] — [supporting evidence]

## Methodology
How the research was conducted.

## Detailed Findings

### [Topic 1]
[Evidence, examples, data]

### [Topic 2]
[Evidence, examples, data]

## Recommendations
- [Action item based on findings]
- [Action item based on findings]

## Open Questions
- [What we still don't know]
- [Suggested follow-up research]
```

## Writing Guide

- **Key Insights** — Top 3-5 findings, ranked by impact. Each backed by evidence.
- **Methodology** — Brief: what was researched, how, and what sources were used
- **Detailed Findings** — Organized by theme, not by source. Include evidence inline.
- **Recommendations** — Actionable next steps, tied to specific findings
- **Open Questions** — Honest about gaps. Suggest specific follow-up research, not vague "more research needed"

## Quality Checks

- Every insight backed by data, examples, or established research
- Findings are specific ("users abandon checkout at step 3") not vague ("users have problems")
- Recommendations are actionable ("add progress indicator to checkout") not aspirational ("improve UX")
- Contradictory evidence acknowledged, not hidden
