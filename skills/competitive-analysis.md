# Competitive Analysis

Structured method for analyzing how competitors and best-in-class products solve a specific problem.

## Process

1. **Identify targets** — Pick 3-5 relevant competitors or best-in-class examples
2. **Document approaches** — Record how each handles the specific problem
3. **Evaluate** — Note strengths, weaknesses, and unique approaches for each
4. **Capture evidence** — Screenshot or describe key interactions
5. **Synthesize** — Find patterns across competitors, identify gaps and opportunities

## Output

Use the [research summary](research-summary.md) skill to structure findings.

## Quality Checks

- Every claim backed by evidence (screenshots, links, specific examples)
- Focused on the specific problem, not general company overviews
- Strengths and weaknesses noted honestly — no cherry-picking
- Patterns identified across multiple competitors, not just individual observations
