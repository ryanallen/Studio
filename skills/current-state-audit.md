# Current State Audit

Structured method for documenting how something works today before proposing changes.

## Process

1. **Walk the flow** — Document the existing experience step by step
2. **Identify friction** — Flag pain points, confusion, and unnecessary steps
3. **Preserve what works** — Note what's good (don't throw out working things)
4. **Map decision points** — Chart the user flow with branches and edge cases
5. **Check accessibility** — Flag WCAG violations, keyboard nav issues, screen reader gaps

## Output

Use the [research summary](research-summary.md) skill to structure findings.

## Quality Checks

- Complete flow documented, not just the happy path
- Pain points backed by specific evidence, not assumptions
- Existing strengths explicitly called out
- Accessibility issues flagged with WCAG criteria references
