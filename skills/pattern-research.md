# Pattern Research

Structured method for finding established UX patterns, design system conventions, and industry standards relevant to a design problem.

## Process

1. **Search established sources** — Nielsen Norman Group, Baymard Institute, Smashing Magazine, etc.
2. **Check design systems** — Material Design, Apple HIG, Carbon, Atlassian, etc.
3. **Review accessibility patterns** — WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, inclusive design patterns
4. **Document variations** — List pattern variants and when each is appropriate
5. **Note trade-offs** — Pros/cons of each pattern, contexts where they work or fail

## Output

Use the [research summary](research-summary.md) skill to structure findings.

## Quality Checks

- Sources cited for every pattern referenced
- Multiple pattern options presented, not just one
- Trade-offs explicit — no pattern is universally best
- Accessibility patterns given equal weight to visual/interaction patterns
