## Skills

- [commit-all](../skills/commit-all/SKILL.md) – stage all changes, create one commit (no push)
- [sync-upstream](../skills/sync-upstream/SKILL.md) – pull from upstream main, push to origin main

Use the appropriate skill when the user asks to commit, sync, pull, or push. GitHub-focused; assumes `upstream` and `origin` remotes.
