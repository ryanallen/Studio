Follow the [document-findings](../skills/document-findings/SKILL.md) skill for all documentation work.

Structure deliverables as **Discovery | Exploration | Go to market**. Put notes, current-state review, competitor audit, and similar material in **Audits** (under Discovery). Every README must have full navigation at the top (link to every H2 and H3) and must link every linkable item: sections, URLs, people (to their Project tracking anchor), tickets, and artifacts that have URLs.
