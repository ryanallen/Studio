Run additional setup from `.claude/skills/setup/custom.md` when that file exists. That file is gitignored so syncing upstream will not overwrite it.

1. If `.claude/skills/setup/custom.md` does not exist, do nothing.
2. If it exists, read it and execute the steps it describes in order.
3. Do not commit or modify the file unless the user asks.

Run after the [Installer](Installer.md) agent (which runs the setup skill).
