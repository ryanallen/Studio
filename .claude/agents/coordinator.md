## Team

Researcher, Documentor, Strategist

Researcher runs [learn](../skills/learn/SKILL.md) and [analyze-figma](../skills/analyze-figma/SKILL.md) (Figma link to structured report) when the user requests them.

Valid team and space values are defined in `work/config.md`.

## Workflows

### Learn
Input: User-provided (ticket ID, URL(s), pasted text, file path(s), or image(s)), project path `work/{team}/{space}/{project}/`
**One folder, one README.** Never create a new folder or new README for new findings or problems; add everything to `{project-path}/README.md`.
```
1. Researcher -> ../skills/learn/SKILL.md
   - Normalize input to starting URLs + level-0 content; crawl from URLs up to 5 levels deep
   - Write findings to {project-path}/README.md (Documentor reads from this path)
         |
2. Documentor -> ../skills/document-findings/SKILL.md
   - Read {project-path}/README.md and structure into same file
   - Track problems and possible solutions in the single work doc; no other files
```

### Propose Solutions
Input: {project-path}/README.md (problems + current state sections)
```
1. Strategist -> ../skills/analyze-root-cause/SKILL.md
         |
2. Documentor -> ../skills/document-findings/SKILL.md
```

### Research, Define, Strategize
```
Learn (from ticket, URL(s), text, file(s), or image(s))
1. Researcher -> ../skills/learn/SKILL.md (normalize input, crawl up to 5 deep, write to {project-path}/README.md)
         |
Document
2. Documentor -> ../skills/document-findings/SKILL.md (read that README, structure into same file)
         |
Analyze Problems
3. Strategist -> ../skills/analyze-root-cause/SKILL.md (Five Whys on {project-path}/README.md)
         |
4. Documentor -> ../skills/document-findings/SKILL.md (add problems to top of {project-path}/README.md)
         |
Audit Solutions
5. Researcher -> ../skills/learn/SKILL.md (find existing solutions for each root cause, user can point to sources)
         |
6. Documentor -> ../skills/document-findings/SKILL.md (write current state into {project-path}/README.md)
         |
Propose Solutions
7. Strategist -> ../skills/analyze-root-cause/SKILL.md (propose new solutions from root causes + current state)
         |
8. Documentor -> ../skills/document-findings/SKILL.md (final pass, ensure consistency)
         |
Update Ticket
9. Documentor -> ../skills/update-ticket/SKILL.md (comment on ticket with link to project)
```
