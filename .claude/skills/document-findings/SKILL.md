# Document Findings

Take research output and produce structured, enhanced markdown documentation.

## Inputs

1. **Project path** - `work/{team}/{space}/{project}/`
2. **Source material** - Research output to structure
3. **Document type** - One of: `research`, `analysis`, `solutions`, `project-overview`

If the project path or source material is missing, ask the user before proceeding.

Valid team and space values are defined in `work/config.md`.

## Output

All project documentation lives in a single file: `work/{team}/{space}/{project}/README.md`. Do not create other files (notes, drafts, separate docs) for the project; write everything into this README. **One folder, one README:** Never create a new project path, new folder, or a new README. When you discover or document a new problem or topic, add it to this same README (e.g. Problems section, Audits, a new subsection). Multiple problems and topics are tracked in this one file; do not split them into new folders or files.

## Markdown Standards

### Headings
Use H2 (`##`) as top-level within documents. Reserve H1 (`#`) for the document title only.

### Mermaid Diagrams

Use mermaid for:
- **Flowcharts** - Processes, workflows, decision trees
- **Sequence diagrams** - Multi-step interactions
- **Mind maps** - Problem breakdowns, topic relationships
- **Gantt charts** - Timelines, phases

Example for a workflow:
````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action]
    B -->|No| D[Alternative]
```
````

Example for root cause:
````markdown
```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Problem))
    Why 1
      Why 2
        Why 3
          Root Cause
```
````

### Tables
Use tables for structured comparisons, source indexes, and feature matrices. Only add rows when source material provides real data. Never add placeholder rows, TBD, example data, or made-up names/dates/artifacts.

### Callouts
Use blockquotes with bold labels for callouts:
```markdown
> **Note:** Additional context here.

> **Warning:** Risk or caveat here.
```

### Links and Sources
Always cite sources inline with markdown links. Group full source lists in tables.

**Clickable links:** Every reference to a source or URL must use markdown link syntax `[title](url)` so it renders as a clickable link in the README. Never write the link title and URL as separate plain text or as a bare URL.

**Link everything that can be linked.** Do not leave linkable items as plain text. In scope:
- **Sections:** Include a full table of contents (see README Structure) linking to every section.
- **URLs:** Use `[title](url)` for every source, doc, or external reference.
- **People:** In Project tracking > Team, give each person a document anchor (e.g. `<a id="jane-doe"></a>` before the name, or a heading). Anywhere that person appears (notes, Audits, Deliverables, Artifacts, etc.), link their name to that anchor (e.g. `[Jane Doe](#jane-doe)`).
- **Tickets:** When a ticket ID or URL exists, link it (e.g. `[PROJ-123](url)` or link the ID).
- **Artifacts / docs:** If an artifact or doc has a URL, link it.

When in doubt, add the link.

## Process

### 1. Read Source Material
Read all files from the source path. Understand the scope and topics covered.

### 2. Organize by Sections
Map content into the README sections based on document type.

### 3. Write README
- Start with a clear title and one-line summary
- Use mermaid diagrams where relationships or flows exist
- Use tables where comparisons or indexes exist
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)
- Cite sources inline

### 4. README Structure

Use a single README with three phases. **Full navigation at the top:** after the H1 title, add a table of contents that links to every H2 and H3 in the document so readers can jump to any section (Discovery, Exploration, Go to market, and every subsection under them). Notes, current-state review, competitor audit, and similar material go in **Audits** (under Discovery). Section headers below describe what goes in each place when source material provides it; do not populate tables or sections with placeholder, example, or made-up data. If there is no real data for a table or subsection, leave it empty or omit it.

```markdown
# {Project Name}
Full nav (link every H2 and H3 that exists in the doc, e.g.):
- [Discovery](#discovery)
  - [Project tracking](#project-tracking)
  - [Audits](#audits)
  - [Users + Needs](#users--needs)
- [Exploration](#exploration)
  - [Ideation](#ideation)
  - [Artifacts](#artifacts)
  - [Validation](#validation)
- [Go to market](#go-to-market)
  - [Deliverables](#deliverables)
  - [Performance](#performance)
  - [Next version](#next-version)
(Include only sections that exist; use same anchor format for headings.)

---
## Discovery

### Project tracking
- **Team:** One row per person. Name = individual contributor (person's full name, not team or space). Responsibility = exactly one of: **Driver**, **Approver**, **Contributor**, **Informed** (DACI only; no other values). Example: ticket assignee (e.g. Ryan Allen on the UX ticket) is **Contributor**; the person who assigned the ticket is at least **Informed** (and may also be Driver, Approver, or Contributor).
- **Roadmap:** Project + ticket | Due date.
- **Measurements:** Name | Current state | Desired state.

### Audits
Notes, current-state review, competitor review. Track artifacts in Exploration > Artifacts. When source material includes a **Link tree** or **Sources** section (e.g. from learn output), preserve it here: include a "Link tree" subsection with the full traversal map and optionally a Sources table so every crawled link remains in the README.

### Users + Needs
Users raw & encoded needs (User | Time/date | Verbatim | Encoded needs). Sorted needs. Refined problem statement (In which way might we enable ${user} to solve ${mainNeed1} & ${mainNeed2}, to ${userGoal} & ${businessGoal}?).

---
## Exploration

### Ideation
Hypotheses (If | then | due to).

### Artifacts
Artifacts table (Date | Creator | Artifact). Drawings, surveys, flow charts, prototypes, UI, code repos. **Design files:** physical design files (e.g. Figma, Sketch); link or list with Creator and Artifact.

### Validation
Test plan (general, users, goals). User testing results (Version | KPI 1 | KPI 2).

---
## Go to market

### Deliverables
Designs for engineers (Date | Creator | Artifact). Production roadmap (Project name | Due date | Status | Person assigned).

### Performance
Quality assurance. Production testing (Version | KPI 1 | KPI 2).

### Next version
Learnings. Recommendations. Links to new docs.
```

## Rules

- Never use absolute filesystem paths in links. All links must be relative to the document they appear in
- Every source or URL reference must be a markdown link `[title](url)` so it is clickable; never plain text title with URL elsewhere or bare URL
- Never invent information not present in source material. No placeholder or made-up content anywhere: no fake table rows, no TBD, no example names/dates/artifacts in Deliverables, Project tracking, Roadmap, or any other section. Only real data from source material; leave sections or tables empty when there is nothing to put.
- In Project tracking > Team: Name must be an individual person (full name). Responsibility must be exactly one of Driver, Approver, Contributor, Informed (DACI). No other roles or labels.
- When structuring from research that includes a Link tree or Sources section, preserve them in the README (e.g. under Discovery > Audits) so the full link tree is always present
- **One folder, one README:** Never create a new project path, folder, or README for new problems or findings. Add all problems, topics, and updates to the existing project README only.
- Always attribute content to its source
- Use mermaid diagrams for any process with 3+ steps or any hierarchy with 2+ levels
- Always include a full table of contents after the H1 title: link to every H2 and H3 section so readers can navigate to all parts of the document
