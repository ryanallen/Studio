# Commit All

Stage everything since the last commit and create a single commit with a title and description. Do not push.

## Inputs

**Title and description:** You must derive these from the work done (files changed, what was added or fixed), don't ask the user for them. If needed, inspect the diff or changed files to write them.
## Command

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Title" -m "Description"
```

## Steps

1. Run `git status` and inspect what changed. Derive a short title and optional description from the changes.
2. Run `git add -A` to stage all changes.
3. Run `git commit -m "<title>" -m "<description>"`.
4. Report the result. Do not run `git push`.

## Error Handling

- **Nothing to commit (working tree clean):** Tell the user there are no changes to commit.
- **Cannot infer message:** Only then ask the user for a title (and optional description).
