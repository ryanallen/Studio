# Setup Instructions:
# ===================
# 1. Copy this file to .env
#
# 2. For READ-ONLY access (viewing files, exporting, comments):
#    - Get your Figma Personal Access Token:
#      - Log in to Figma
#      - Go to Settings > Security > Personal access tokens
#      - Generate new token with appropriate scopes
#      - Copy the token (you'll only see it once!)
#    - Replace FIGMA_API_TOKEN placeholder with your actual token
#    - The MCP server will store this at: ~/.mcp-figma/config.json
#
# 3. For FULL READ/WRITE access (creating and editing designs):
#    - Open Figma desktop app (not browser)
#    - Enable Dev Mode with Shift+D
#    - In the inspect panel, enable the MCP server
#    - The server runs locally at http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp
#    - Add to ~/.claude.json: "figma-local": {"url": "http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp", "type": "http"}
#    - Restart Claude Code to load the new MCP configuration
#
